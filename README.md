Description
-----------

The purpose of this task was provide functionality to sort through a collection of messages according to several criteria. To accomplish this, the Collections.sort method and the comparator interface in Java were used. This project was developed using the Eclipse IDE. It consists of an app based on the MVC architecture, and can be run through Eclipse in the console. 

Instructions
------------

1. Create a temp folder and initialise a git repo within. Clone the contents of this repo to the local repo.

2. Create a new java project in eclipse, within the src folder create packages called:
 * controllers 
 * models
 * utils
 * views 

3. Into each package import the corresponding .java files from the cloned repo by doing the following:
 * Right click on the package
 * Continue as follows: `import/File System`
 * Browse to the cloned local repo
 * Select the files from the folder whose name corresponds to the package
 * Click finish

4. Finally, right click on the src folder and continue as follows: 
 * `Build Path/Configure Build Path.../`
 * Click `libraries` then `Add external JARs...`
 * Browse to the stdiolib.jar file within the libs folder
 * Click Ok.


The project is now ready and Main.java in the Controllers package can be executed. From there follow the instructions in the console.
